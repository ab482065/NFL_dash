## Things To Do

### **Basic Objectives**

### **Repo Objectives**

- **~~Rename GitHub (**_NOT_** local) project name to something more expressive (e.g. `nfl-dashboard` -> `nfl-analytics-dashboard`).~~**
- Upload project banner image to project repository.
  - Upload project banner image to assets subdirectory (e.g. `project-banner.png` -> `assets/project-banner.png`).
- Hide `.ipynb_checkpoints/`, `.DS_Store`, and other unnecessary files/directories through better usage of `.gitignore`.
- Compartmentalize project by including `eda.ipynb` in a subdirectory of your naming choice (e.g. `eda.ipynb` -> `notebooks/eda.ipynb`).
  - You can also choose to rename your notebook file to something more explicit/descriptive (e.g. `eda.ipynb` -> `nfl-investigative-analysis.ipynb`).
- Add more badges!
