<a id="objective-position-specific-tabs" />

**~~Position-Specific Tabs~~**

- ~~Create tabs for each player position: QBs, RBs, and WRs.~~
- ~~Display a dropdown to select a player from the chosen position.~~
- ~~Display a radio button group to choose a specific statistic (e.g., yards, touchdowns) for the selected player.~~
- ~~Show a bar chart representing the chosen statistic for each game the player participated in.~~
- ~~Provide detailed statistics for a selected game upon clicking on a game in the bar chart.~~

<a id="objective-export-sharing-tabs" />

**~~Export and Sharing Options:~~**

- ~~Enable users to export selected data and visualizations for further analysis or sharing.~~
- ~~Add buttons or links to export data as CSV or Excel files for offline analysis.~~
- ~~Implement social media sharing buttons to allow users to share interesting insights or visualizations.~~
- ~~Provide an option to generate and download high-resolution images of graphs and charts.~~

<a id="interactive-data-filters-tabs" />

**Interactive Data Filters:**

- Allow users to filter and explore data based on specific criteria.
- Implement dropdown menus or input fields to filter data by season, team, or player attributes.
- Provide users with the ability to apply multiple filters simultaneously to refine their analysis.
- Update visualizations and statistics dynamically based on the selected filters.

**Customization and Personalization:**

- Allow users to customize the dashboard layout and content based on their preferences.
- Implement a dashboard settings panel that lets users choose the default view, preferred statistics, and visualizations.
- Provide options to rearrange and resize dashboard components to create a personalized layout.
- Allow users to save their customizations for future visits.

## **Advanced Project Objectives**

**Performance Analysis by Position:**

- Provide users with insights into the performance of different positions (Quarterbacks, Running Backs, and Wide Receivers) over the seasons.
- Display key statistics such as passing yards, rushing yards, and receiving yards for each position.
- Allow users to select a specific player and view their detailed statistics.
- Show graphical representations (e.g., bar charts) of selected statistics for each position.

**Game Impact Analysis:**

- Enable users to analyze the impact of specific games on player performance, including touchdowns and yardage.
- Display game-by-game statistics for touchdowns, passing yards, and rushing yards for selected players.
- Allow users to click on a game in the graph to view detailed statistics for that game, including pass attempts, completions, and rushing attempts.
- Highlight exceptional game performances through color-coded visuals based on specified thresholds.

**Player Comparison and Trend Analysis:**

- Provide a platform for users to compare multiple players' statistics and observe performance trends over seasons.
- Enable users to select and compare statistics of two or more players simultaneously.
- Display line charts showing the trend of key statistics (e.g., passing yards, rushing touchdowns) over the seasons for the selected players.
- Allow users to customize the visualization by choosing different statistics and timeframes (seasons or years).

## **~~Repository Objectives~~**

- ~~Rename GitHub (**_NOT_** local) project name to something more expressive (e.g. `nfl-dashboard` -> `nfl-analytics-dashboard`).~~
- ~~Upload project banner image to project repository.~~
  - Upload project banner image to assets subdirectory (e.g. `project-banner.png` -> `assets/project-banner.png`).
- ~~Hide `.ipynb_checkpoints/`, `.DS_Store`, and other unnecessary files/directories through better usage of `.gitignore`.~~
- ~~Compartmentalize project by including `eda.ipynb` in a subdirectory of your naming choice (e.g. `eda.ipynb` -> `notebooks/eda.ipynb`).~~
  - ~~You can also choose to rename your notebook file to something more explicit/descriptive (e.g. `eda.ipynb` -> `nfl-investigative-analysis.ipynb`).~~
- ~~Add more badges!~~
